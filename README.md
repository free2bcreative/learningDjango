#Learning Django

I've decided to just sit down and just learn Django instead of "dipping" in here and there.  

This code will evolve as I go through the tutorial.  The tutorial is from [The Django Book](http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/ "The Django Book").

##Cookies
I skipped ahead to Chapter 14 and am learning about cookies.  I'm uploading a brief example of how to do that within my main "mysite/views.py" file.  It is located in the my_homepage_view function.

Pretty cool stuff!
